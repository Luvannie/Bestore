            "description": "I became intensely interested in Dragon Worship and the Dragon Myth during my recent journey in China and Mongolia in support of the Central Asiatic Expeditions of Roy Chapman Andrews. Especially, in the royal city of Peking appears the apotheosis of the Dragon in every conceivable form of symbolism and architecture. The Dragons leading up to the steps of the temples and palaces of the Manchu emperors, and the superb dragon-screen guarding the approach to one of the royal palaces, are but two of the innumerable examples of the universal former belief in these mythical animals, and of the still prevailing beliefs among the common people of China. For example, one night in a far distant telegraph station in the heart of the desert of Gobi, I overheard two men pointing out Leader Andrews and myself as ‘men of the Dragon bones.’ On inquiry, I learned that our great Central Asiatic Expedition was universally regarded by the natives as engaged in the quest of remains of extinct Dragons, and that this superstition is connected with the still universal belief among the natives that fossil bones, and especially fossil teeth have a high medicinal value. Not long after my return from Central Asia, I suggested to my friend, Ernest Ingersoll, that he write the present volume, preparing a fresh study of the history of the Dragon Myth which, now largely confined to China, once spread all over Asia and Europe, as dominant not only in mythology but entering even into the early teachings of Christianity, as so many other pagan myths have done. I knew that the author was well-qualified for a work of this character, because of his remarkable success in previous volumes for old and young, and in his original observations on various forms of animal life, from the American oyster to many birds and mammals. He is especially versed, perhaps, in regard to one very interesting question which is often asked, namely, how far the animals of myth and of legend, like the Dragon, the Hydra, the Phoenix, the Unicorn and the Mermaid, are products of pure imagination, and how far due to some fancied resemblance of a living form or to the tales of travelers. For example, it occurred to me, while examining the giant fossil eggs of the extinct ostrich of China (now known under the scientific name Struthiolithus, assigned by the late Doctor Eastman), that it may have given rise to the myth of the Phoenix or of the Roc.",

Many cultures even agree on what the giant serpents look like, though they may differ on whether these mythical creatures are benevolent or evil. This ultra-compelling volume takes readers on a tour of world cultures and dragon lore. Sometimes, this folklore is entwined with actual historical events, such as a Roman general's supposed encounter with a water-spewing dragon on a march to Africa. Breathtaking images and fascinating fact boxes contribute to this extremely high-interest text.",

Meet the fire-breathing beasts of mythology in this beautifully illustrated ebook brimming with scaled behemoths. Lurking in every corner of the earth, from the deepest depths of the oceans, to the tips of the tallest mountains, even tucked beneath the very ground that you tread on, dragons watch and wait. They take many forms--sea monsters, serpents, wild cats, eagles, and they represent many different things; Gods to be revered, evil kings to be feared, wise friends, and fierce foes. So, when you accidentally step on a sinewy vine and it whips out from under your feet, or invisible forces gently fan warm air across your face, or the acrid smell of cinders pokes at the back of your throat, how will you know whether to stand and wonder, or run and hide? Dragons have breathed fire into our minds since we could first imagine, but why do they exist in stories from every land in the world? Come in and explore Dragon World. Look into their lairs while they make shape-shifting mischief, playing with the weather and protecting earthly treasures. Soar across continents into tales as old as time. Prowl through the pages to discover rare dragon species. Find clues to track them and master how to draw them. Behold the earthly dragons of today!",

But his luck finally changes when he’s chosen to train as a Dragon Rider at the prestigious Dragon Academy. Thrust into a world where he doesn’t fit in, Seb finds the connection with his dragon more powerful than he ever imagined. Soon, he’s doing all he can to succeed and not embarrass his new dragon partner, Thea. High-born Agathea Flamma intends to bring honor to her family by following in her brothers’ footsteps and taking her rightful place as a Dragon Rider. If she does not succeed, her only other option is marriage, and Thea will not accept failure. She’s not thrilled with her awkward, scruffy partner, Seb, but their dragon has chosen, and now the unlikely duo must learn to work as a team. When Seb hears rumors that an old danger is reemerging, he and Thea begin to investigate. Armed only with their determination and the dragon they both ride, Thea and Seb may be the only defense against the Darkening that threatens to sweep the land. Together, they will have to learn to work together to save their kingdom…or watch it fall and along with it their own dreams.",

The once-peaceful kingdom of Torvald has been ravaged by evil magic, forcing Riders to forget their dragons and their noble beasts to flee to the wilds. Now, anyone who dares to speak of dragons is deemed insane and put to death. Into this dark and twisted land, Saffron was born sixteen years ago. Blessed with the gift of dragon affinity, she has been forced into a life of exile, secretly dreaming of a normal life and the family she lost. Scholarly and reclusive, Bower is the son of a noble house on the brink of destruction. His mission is to fulfill a mysterious prophecy and save his kingdom from the rule of the evil King Enric, but all he wants is to be left alone. When he meets Saffron, Bower gains a powerful ally—but her magic is too wild to control. Their friendship might just have the power to change the course of history, but when the Dark Mage King Enric makes Saffron a tempting offer, their alliance will be shaken to the core.",

A peasant on a large dragon estate, she goes unnoticed by the Temple of the Dragon—until she accidentally captures the attention of an eccentric and dangerous dragonmaster, unleashing a storm of tragedy. Her clan is plunged into destitution, her beautiful sister, Waivia, sold into slavery, and her mother lost to madness. Desperate to find Waivia, Zarq and her delirious mother flee through the underworld of their land. Consumed with the desire for revenge, Zarq develops a taste for the highly addictive venom of the dragons she has been taught to revere—and with this poison, she imbibes their memories and glimpses a plot for social revolution. But to achieve it, she must defy not just sexual taboos and patriarchal conventions, but the Emperor who rules her nation.",

Dragons with no remorse, no sympathy, and no use for humans. Dragons who destroyed an entire village and everyone in it. Everyone, that is, except the young boy Arlian. Orphaned and alone, Arlian was captured by looters and sold as a mining slave. Seven years later he escaped, fueled by years of hatred for the dragons, bandits, and slavers who took away his youth-and a personal vow to exact retribution from all those who have wronged him, including the powerful Lord Enziet Arlian's entire life has one purpose, and one purpose only: to mete out justice. And in the climactic battle of Dragon Weather Lord Enziet fell to this justice. In The Dragon Society Arlian returns to Manfort, the city that is home to The Dragon Society, whose sworn purpose is to stand against the dragon menace, and whose foremost member had been Lord Enziet. Arlian must immediately deal with the consequences of Enziet's death. But what he finds is shocking, for the doomed Enziet believes that Arlian might well be the best hope humanity will ever have for defeating the dragons . . . permanently.

The entrance of a human baby into a gathering of dragons sets off a chain of events that leads to the dragons \"Coming Out\" to present themselves to humans in a way they have never done before. Read the stories of 13 dragons and see their special portraits. Follow them as they learn to use their gifts and sometimes get into lots of trouble when they decide to take short cuts or listen to the advice of a very precocious human baby who, by the way, has dragon blood running through his veins. Did you know that some humans have dragon blood running through their veins? Would you like to find out why? Open these pages and follow the adventures of the dragons and Lucas as they wend their way through the trials and tribulations of growing up. You will also be introduced to some of the special gifts that dragons have that they put to good use. Maybe you can learn those gifts too or find out that perhaps you already know how to use them. This book is especially for those who know how to believe.",

And not the Book Kaylee and the rest of the world knows. If the Slayers get their hands on this one, it won’t just be the end of Kaylee, but all dragon-kin. But even while the Slayer threat grows, a dangerous stranger from Kaylee’s past has arrived to mentor her unstable storm magic with methods that push Kaylee to her limits. Even with her relationship to Edwin growing, the emergence of deadly secrets close to home threaten to tear her friends and family apart. Soon, this could be a war on all sides. A war she might not win. Dragon’s Curse is the second book in the complete YA fantasy Heir of Dragons series. If you like snarky, fast-paced fantasies full of dragon shifters, twisting mysteries, and a slow-burn romance, this series is for you!",

His career as a courier driver was hardly something to brag about and although he raced cars on the weekend, life seemed to have slowed to a crawl. For his housemate and best friend James, however, life was peachy; he was about to ask out the girl of his dreams and was entering his final year at university. Social media sensation Emma Riley was living her best life: her following was booming, her sponsors were calling, and people just could not get enough of her. If only her father, Thomas, could get off her back once in a while. Will was ready for the next big step. The restaurant was booked, the evening was planned, and the diamond ring was perfect. All he hoped now was that Lila, his girlfriend of four years, would say yes. But after a mysterious fire-breathing creature leaves the Australian city of the Gold Coast in ruins, this group of strangers are forced to leave their old lives behind and band together in a fight for survival. With no way to communicate with the outside world and no help in sight, a greater mystery begins to unfold around them. What is the monster that attacked the city? Where did it come from? Is our reign, our way of life, really over? Is the dragon’s reign about to begin?",

Though he had few years and was not built for football, he stood between the town of Trondheim and creatures that threatened its survival. There have always been dragons. As far back as history is told, men and women have fought them, loyally defending their villages. Dragon slaying was a proud tradition. But dragons and humans have one thing in common: an insatiable appetite for fossil fuels. From the moment Henry Ford hired his first dragon slayer, no small town was safe. Dragon slayers flocked to cities, leaving more remote areas unprotected. Such was Trondheim's fate until Owen Thorskard arrived. At sixteen, with dragons advancing and his grades plummeting, Owen faced impossible odds?armed only with a sword, his legacy, and the classmate who agreed to be his bard. Listen! I am Siobhan McQuaid. I alone know the story of Owen, the story that changes everything. Listen!",

Her childhood was a simple one, sleeping on a straw mat in a tiny bedroom which she at first shared with both her grandmother and sister. As Jean grew up she developed a fascination for medicine and moved to the UK to attend medical school, eventually becoming a consultant psychiatrist. This book is her account of a childhood steeped in the culture of China, and first steps in a career in medicine. Central to the story is the character of Jean's Chinese grandmother, a charismatic matriarch who gave her a rich understanding of Chinese culture and an oriental outlook which has never left her.ÿ",

In Bones of the Dragon, Skylan Ivorson is a sea-raider of the Vindras and eventually becomes the Chief of Chiefs of all Vindras clans, an honor he truly feels he deserves as one who has been blessed by Skoval, the god of war. But sometimes a blessing is a curse in disguise. Skoval and the other ancient gods are under siege from a new generation of gods who are challenging them for the powers of creation... and the only way to stop these brash interlopers lies within the mysterious and hidden Five Bones of the Vektan Dragons. It will be up to the Vindras people, as the dragon-goddess's champions, to undertake the quest to recover all Five. The fate of the Old Gods and the Vindras rests on their recovery--for this is not only a quest to save the world. It is also a quest for redemption. Welcome to the World of Dragonships!

Those two items were the cornerstone of her existence.An altercation at a baby shower leads to her discovering another side to herself. That side was big, crystalline, and caused the other dragons in her vicinity to bow their heads. Defending her friend had led her into this new shape, and now, she was stuck with it.Taken to the central hub of the dragon council, she trades her cooperation for knowledge and freedoms. She had been an independent woman a lot longer than she had been a dragon, and she wasn't going to lose her lifestyle just because she could suddenly breathe blasts of pure energy.Along the way, she learns about where she came from, and it gives her an outline for the life she wants, with the dragon of her choosing.",

A headline that’s about as believable as the existence of dragons. Truth or hoax? Daphne isn’t paying much attention because she’s busy geeking out over the awesome relics that just came into her museum. She’s giddy at the prospect of getting to see them up close, until she drops one. In her defense, she was attacked...by a guy made of smoke. Things might have turned out really bad if she’d not been rescued by a stranger. A man who is also a dragon. Yup. Dragon. It turns out they are real and super hot. Azrael is also domineering and dangerous with the most toe-curling embrace. But passion will have to wait. Azrael needs Daphne to help him save the world. With two of the seven seals broken, they will have to work fast before a monster is released from its prison. genre: dragon romance, horsemen of the apocalypse, paranormal romance, fantasy romance, action and adventure romance, wizard romance",
