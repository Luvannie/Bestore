Drawing heavily on the author's own real-world experiences, the book stresses design and analysis. Coverage is divided into two parts, the first being a general guide to techniques for the design and analysis of computer algorithms. The second is a reference section, which includes a catalog of the 75 most important algorithmic problems. By browsing this catalog, readers can quickly identify what the problem they have encountered is called, what is known about it, and how they should proceed if they need to solve it. This book is ideal for the working professional who uses algorithms on a daily basis and has need for a handy reference. This work can also readily be used in an upper-division course or as a student reference guide.THE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL comes with a CD-ROM that contains:* a complete hypertext version of the full printed book.* the source code and URLs for all cited implementations.* over 30 hours of audio lectures on the design and analysis of algorithms are provided, all keyed to on-line lecture notes.",

Solutions to many problems are provided to let students check their progress, while class-tested PowerPoint slides are on the web for anyone running the course. By looking at both the big picture and easy step-by-step methods for developing algorithms, the author guides students around the common pitfalls. He stresses paradigms such as loop invariants and recursion to unify a huge range of algorithms into a few meta-algorithms. The book fosters a deeper understanding of how and why each algorithm works. These insights are presented in a careful and clear way, helping students to think abstractly and preparing them for creating their own innovative ways to solve problems.",

It has two components: (1) problem identification and formulation, and (2) the solution to the formulated problem. One can solve a problem on its own using ad hoc techniques or by following techniques that have produced efficient solutions to similar problems. This requires the understanding of various algorithm design techniques, how and when to use them to formulate solutions, and the context appropriate for each of them. Algorithms: Design Techniques and Analysis advocates the study of algorithm design by presenting the most useful techniques and illustrating them with numerous examples — emphasizing on design techniques in problem solving rather than algorithms topics like searching and sorting. Algorithmic analysis in connection with example algorithms are explored in detail. Each technique or strategy is covered in its own chapter through numerous examples of problems and their algorithms. Readers will be equipped with problem solving tools needed in advanced courses or research in science and engineering.

            "description": "Once again, Robert Sedgewick provides a current and comprehensive introduction to important algorithms. The focus this time is on graph algorithms, which are increasingly critical for a wide range of applications, such as network connectivity, circuit design, scheduling, transaction processing, and resource allocation. In this book, Sedgewick offers the same successful blend of theory and practice that has made his work popular with programmers for many years. Michael Schidlowsky and Sedgewick have developed concise new Java implementations that both express the methods in a natural and direct manner and also can be used in real applications. Algorithms in Java, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms is the second book in Sedgewick's thoroughly revised and rewritten series. The first book, Parts 1-4, addresses fundamental algorithms, data structures, sorting, and searching. A forthcoming third book will focus on strings, geometry, and a range of advanced algorithms. Each book's expanded coverage features new algorithms and implementations, enhanced descriptions and diagrams, and a wealth of new exercises for polishing skills. The natural match between Java classes and abstract data type (ADT) implementations makes the code more broadly useful and relevant for the modern object-oriented programming environment. The Web site for this book (www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) provides additional source code for programmers along with a variety of academic support materials for educators. Coverage includes: A complete overview of graph properties and types Diagraphs and DAGs Minimum spanning trees Shortest paths Network flows Diagrams, sample Java code, and detailed algorithm descriptions A landmark revision, Algorithms in Java, Third Edition, Part 5 provides a complete tool set for programmers to implement, debug, and use graph algorithms across a wide range of computer applications.",

The thirteen chapters cover: Models of Computation, Lists, Induction and Recursion, Trees, Algorithm Design, Hashing, Heaps, Balanced Trees, Sets Over a Small Universe, Graphs, Strings, Discrete Fourier Transform, Parallel Computation. Key features: Complicated concepts are expressed clearly in a single page with minimal notation and without the \"clutter\" of the syntax of a particular programming language; algorithms are presented with self-explanatory \"pseudo-code.\" * Chapters 1-4 focus on elementary concepts, the exposition unfolding at a slower pace. Sample exercises with solutions are provided. Sections that may be skipped for an introductory course are starred. Requires only some basic mathematics background and some computer programming experience. * Chapters 5-13 progress at a faster pace. The material is suitable for undergraduates or first-year graduates who need only review Chapters 1 -4. * This book may be used for a one-semester introductory course (based on Chapters 1-4 and portions of the chapters on algorithm design, hashing, and graph algorithms) and for a one-semester advanced course that starts at Chapter 5. A year-long course may be based on the entire book. * Sorting, often perceived as rather technical, is not treated as a separate chapter, but is used in many examples (including bubble sort, merge sort, tree sort, heap sort, quick sort, and several parallel algorithms). Also, lower bounds on sorting by comparisons are included with the presentation of heaps in the context of lower bounds for comparison-based structures. * Chapter 13 on parallel models of computation is something of a mini-book itself, and a good way to end a course. Although it is not clear what parallel",

This book offers a unique approach to taking the design and analyses to the level of predictable practical efficiency, discussing core and classic algorithmic problems that arise in the development of big data applications, and presenting elegant solutions of increasing sophistication and efficiency. Solutions are analyzed within the classic RAM model, and the more practically significant external-memory model that allows one to perform I/O-complexity evaluations. Chapters cover various data types, including integers, strings, trees, and graphs, algorithmic tools such as sampling, sorting, data compression, and searching in dictionaries and texts, and lastly, recent developments regarding compressed data structures. Algorithmic solutions are accompanied by detailed pseudocode and many running examples, thus enriching the toolboxes of students, researchers, and professionals interested in effective and efficient processing of big data.",

It is intended to serve both as a textbook for courses on algorithm design, especially those related to text processing, and as a reference for computer science professionals. The work takes a unique approach, one that goes more deeply into its topic than other more general books. It contains both classical algorithms and recent results of research on the subject. The book is the first text to contain a collection of a wide range of text algorithms, many of them quite new and appearing here for the first time. Other algorithms, while known by reputation, have never been published in the journal literature. Two such important algorithms are those of Karp, Miller and Rosenberg, and that of Weiner. Here they are presented together for the fist time. The core of the book is the material on suffix trees and subword graphs, applications of these data structures, new approaches to time-space optimal string-matching, and text compression. Also covered are basic parallel algorithms for text problems. Applications of all these algorithms are given for problems involving data retrieval systems, treatment of natural languages, investigation of genomes, data compression software, and text processing tools. From the theoretical point of view. the book is a goldmine of paradigms for the development of efficient algorithms, providing the necessary foundation to creating practical software dealing with sequences. A crucial point in the authors' approach is the development of a methodology for presenting text algorithms so they can be fully understood. Throughout, the book emphasizes the efficiency of algorithms, holding that the essence of their usefulness depends on it. This is especially important since the algorithms described here will find application in \"Big Science\" areas like molecular sequence analysis where the explosive growth of data has caused problems for the current generation of software. Finally, with its development of theoretical background, the book can be considered as a mathematical foundation for the analysis and production of text processing algorithms.",

            "description": "Dive Into Algorithms is a broad introduction to algorithms using the Python Programming Language. Dive Into Algorithms is a wide-ranging, Pythonic tour of many of the world's most interesting algorithms. With little more than a bit of computer programming experience and basic high-school math, you'll explore standard computer science algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimization; human-based algorithms that help us determine how to catch a baseball or eat the right amount at a buffet; and advanced algorithms like ones used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. You'll even explore how ancient Egyptians and Russian peasants used algorithms to multiply numbers, how the ancient Greeks used them to find greatest common divisors, and how Japanese scholars in the age of samurai designed algorithms capable of generating magic squares. You'll explore algorithms that are useful in pure mathematics and learn how mathematical ideas can improve algorithms. You'll learn about an algorithm for generating continued fractions, one for quick calculations of square roots, and another for generating seemingly random sets of numbers. You'll also learn how to: • Use algorithms to debug code, maximize revenue, schedule tasks, and create decision trees • Measure the efficiency and speed of algorithms • Generate Voronoi diagrams for use in various geometric applications • Use algorithms to build a simple chatbot, win at board games, or solve sudoku puzzles • Write code for gradient ascent and descent algorithms that can find the maxima and minima of functions • Use simulated annealing to perform global optimization • Build a decision tree to predict happiness based on a person's characteristics Once you've finished this book you'll understand how to code and implement important algorithms as well as how to measure and optimize their performance, all while learning the nitty-gritty details of today's most powerful algorithms.",

Many recent technological innovations and achievements rely on algorithmic ideas – they facilitate new applications in science, medicine, production, logistics, traffic, communi¬cation and entertainment. Efficient algorithms not only enable your personal computer to execute the newest generation of games with features unimaginable only a few years ago, they are also key to several recent scientific breakthroughs – for example, the sequencing of the human genome would not have been possible without the invention of new algorithmic ideas that speed up computations by several orders of magnitude. The greatest improvements in the area of algorithms rely on beautiful ideas for tackling computational tasks more efficiently. The problems solved are not restricted to arithmetic tasks in a narrow sense but often relate to exciting questions of nonmathematical flavor, such as: How can I find the exit out of a maze? How can I partition a treasure map so that the treasure can only be found if all parts of the map are recombined? How should I plan my trip to minimize cost? Solving these challenging problems requires logical reasoning, geometric and combinatorial imagination, and, last but not least, creativity – the skills needed for the design and analysis of algorithms. In this book we present some of the most beautiful algorithmic ideas in 41 articles written in colloquial, nontechnical language. Most of the articles arose out of an initiative among German-language universities to communicate the fascination of algorithms and computer science to high-school students. The book can be understood without any prior knowledge of algorithms and computing, and it will be an enlightening and fun read for students and interested adults.",

The Workshop on Algorithm Engineering covers research on all aspects of the subject. The goal is to present recent research results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Previous meetings were held in Venice (1997), Saarbruc ̈ ken (1998), and London (1999). Papers were solicited describing original research in all aspects of algorithm engineering, including: – Development of software repositories and platforms which allow the use of and experimentation with e?cient discrete algorithms. – Novel uses of discrete algorithms in other disciplines and the evaluation of algorithms for realistic environments. – Methodological issues including standards in the context of empirical - search on algorithms and data structures. – Methodological issues regarding the process of converting user requirements into e?cient algorithmic solutions and implementations. The program committee accepted 16 from a total of 30 submissions. The program committee meeting was conducted electronically. The criteria for sel- tion were originality, quality, and relevance to the subject area of the workshop. Considerable e?ort was devoted to the evaluation of the submissions and to p- viding the authors with feedback. Each submission was reviewed by at least four program committee members (assisted by subreferees). A special issue of the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics will be devoted to selected papers from WAE 2000.",

            "description": "Mechanical Engineering domain problems are generally complex, consisting of different design variables and constraints. These problems may not be solved using gradient-based optimization techniques. The stochastic nature-inspired optimization techniques have been proposed in this book to efficiently handle the complex problems. The nature-inspired algorithms are classified as bio-inspired, swarm, and physics/chemical-based algorithms. Socio-inspired is one of the subdomains of bio-inspired algorithms, and Cohort Intelligence (CI) models the social tendencies of learning candidates with an inherent goal to achieve the best possible position. In this book, CI is investigated by solving ten discrete variable truss structural problems, eleven mixed variable design engineering problems, seventeen linear and nonlinear constrained test problems and two real-world applications from manufacturing domain. Static Penalty Function (SPF) is also adopted to handle the linear and nonlinear constraints, and limitations in CI and SPF approaches are examined. Constraint Handling in Cohort Intelligence Algorithm is a valuable reference to practitioners working in the industry as well as to students and researchers in the area of optimization methods.",

            "description": "An accessible introduction and essential reference for an approach to machine learning that creates highly accurate prediction rules by combining many weak and inaccurate ones. Boosting is an approach to machine learning based on the idea of creating a highly accurate predictor by combining many weak and inaccurate \"rules of thumb.\" A remarkably rich theory has evolved around boosting, with connections to a range of topics, including statistics, game theory, convex optimization, and information geometry. Boosting algorithms have also enjoyed practical success in such fields as biology, vision, and speech processing. At various times in its history, boosting has been perceived as mysterious, controversial, even paradoxical. This book, written by the inventors of the method, brings together, organizes, simplifies, and substantially extends two decades of research on boosting, presenting both theory and applications in a way that is accessible to readers from diverse backgrounds while also providing an authoritative reference for advanced researchers. With its introductory treatment of all material and its inclusion of exercises in every chapter, the book is appropriate for course use as well. The book begins with a general introduction to machine learning algorithms and their analysis; then explores the core theory of boosting, especially its ability to generalize; examines some of the myriad other theoretical viewpoints that help to explain and understand boosting; provides practical extensions of boosting for more complex learning problems; and finally presents a number of advanced theoretical topics. Numerous applications and practical illustrations are offered throughout.",

Focusing on practical issues, A Programmer's Companion to Algorithm Analysis carefully details the transition from the design and analysis of an algorithm to the resulting software program. Consisting of two main complementary parts, the book emphasizes the concrete aspects of translating an algorithm into software that should perform based on what the algorithm analysis indicated. In the first part, the author describes the idealized universe that algorithm designers inhabit while the second part outlines how this ideal can be adapted to the real world of programming. The book explores analysis techniques, including crossover points, the influence of the memory hierarchy, implications of programming language aspects, such as recursion, and problems arising from excessively high computational complexities of solution methods. It concludes with four appendices that discuss basic algorithms; memory hierarchy, virtual memory management, optimizing compilers, and garbage collection; NP-completeness and higher complexity classes; and undecidability in practical terms. Applying the theory of algorithms to the production of software, A Programmer's Companion to Algorithm Analysis fulfills the needs of software programmers and developers as well as students by showing that with the correct algorithm, you can achieve a functional software program.",

It provides a comprehensive elaboration of basic intelligent optimization algorithms, and demonstrates how their improvement, hybridization and parallelization can be applied to manufacturing. Furthermore, various applications of these intelligent optimization algorithms are exemplified in detail, chapter by chapter. The intelligent optimization algorithm is not just a single algorithm; instead it is a general advanced optimization mechanism which is highly scalable with robustness and randomness. Therefore, this book demonstrates the flexibility of these algorithms, as well as their robustness and reusability in order to solve mass complicated problems in manufacturing. Since the genetic algorithm was presented decades ago, a large number of intelligent optimization algorithms and their improvements have been developed. However, little work has been done to extend their applications and verify their competence in solving complicated problems in manufacturing. This book will provide an invaluable resource to students, researchers, consultants and industry professionals interested in engineering optimization. It will also be particularly useful to three groups of readers: algorithm beginners, optimization engineers and senior algorithm designers. It offers a detailed description of intelligent optimization algorithms to algorithm beginners; recommends new configurable design methods for optimization engineers, and provides future trends and challenges of the new configuration mechanism to senior algorithm designers.",

This book presents a bibliographic overview of the field and an anthology of detailed descriptions of the principal algorithms available. The aim is twofold: on the one hand, to provide an easy-to-read comparison of the available techniques in each area, and on the other, to furnish the reader with a reference to in-depth descriptions of the major algorithms. Topics covered include methods for finding exact and approximate string matches, calculating ‘edit’ distances between strings, finding common sequences and finding the longest repetitions within strings. For clarity, all the algorithms are presented in a uniform format and notation.",

The book is suitable either as a textbook or as a supplementary book in algorithm courses. Over 400 computational problems are covered with various algorithms to tackle them. Rather than providing students simply with the best known algorithm for a problem, this book presents various algorithms for readers to master various algorithm design paradigms. Beginners in computer science can train their algorithm design skills via trivial algorithms on elementary problem examples. Graduate students can test their abilities to apply the algorithm design paradigms to devise an efficient algorithm for intermediate-level or challenging problems. Key Features: Dictionary of computational problems: A table of over 400 computational problems with more than 1500 algorithms is provided. Indices and Hyperlinks: Algorithms, computational problems, equations, figures, lemmas, properties, tables, and theorems are indexed with unique identification numbers and page numbers in the printed book and hyperlinked in the e-book version. Extensive Figures: Over 435 figures illustrate the algorithms and describe computational problems. Comprehensive exercises: More than 352 exercises help students to improve their algorithm design and analysis skills. The answers for most questions are available in the accompanying solution manual.",

Evolutionary-based meta-heuristic approaches are increasingly being applied to solve complicated optimization problems in several real-world applications. One of the most successful optimization algorithms is the Cuckoo search (CS), which has become an active research area to solve N-dimensional and linear/nonlinear optimization problems using simple mathematical processes. CS has attracted the attention of various researchers, resulting in the emergence of numerous variants of the basic CS with enhanced performance since 2019.",

Neutrosophic clustering is the generalization of fuzzy clustering and has been applied to many fields. this paper presents a new neutrosophic clustering algorithm with the help of regularization. Firstly, the regularization term is introduced into the FC-PFS algorithm to generate sparsity, which can reduce the complexity of the algorithm on large data sets. Secondly, we propose a method to simplify the process of determining regularization parameters. Finally, experiments show that the clustering results of this algorithm on artificial data sets and real data sets are mostly better than other clustering algorithms. Our clustering algorithm is effective in most cases.",

It gives a practical treatment of algorithmic complexity and guides readers in solving algorithmic problems. Divided into three parts, the book offers a comprehensive set of problems with solutions as well as in-depth case studies that demonstrate how to assess the complexity of a new problem. Part I helps readers understand the main design principles and design efficient algorithms. Part II covers polynomial reductions from NP-complete problems and approaches that go beyond NP-completeness. Part III supplies readers with tools and techniques to evaluate problem complexity, including how to determine which instances are polynomial and which are NP-hard. Drawing on the authors’ classroom-tested material, this text takes readers step by step through the concepts and methods for analyzing algorithmic complexity. Through many problems and detailed examples, readers can investigate polynomial-time algorithms and NP-completeness and beyond.",

These algorithms cover most of the technical bottlenecks encountered in BMS applications, including battery system modeling, state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) estimation, state of power (SOP) estimation, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, heating at low temperature, and optimization of charging. The book not only presents these algorithms, but also discusses their background, as well as related experimental and hardware developments. The concise figures and program codes provided make the calculation process easy to follow and apply, while the results obtained are presented in a comparative way, allowing readers to intuitively grasp the characteristics of different algorithms. Given its scope, the book is intended for researchers, senior undergraduate and graduate students, as well as engineers in the fields of electric vehicles and energy storage.",

            "description": "Calculus has been used in solving many scientific and engineering problems. For optimization problems, however, the differential calculus technique sometimes has a drawback when the objective function is step-wise, discontinuous, or multi-modal, or when decision variables are discrete rather than continuous. Thus, researchers have recently turned their interests into metaheuristic algorithms that have been inspired by natural phenomena such as evolution, animal behavior, or metallic annealing. This book especially focuses on a music-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, harmony search. Interestingly, there exists an analogy between music and optimization: each musical instrument corresponds to each decision variable; musical note corresponds to variable value; and harmony corresponds to solution vector. Just like musicians in Jazz improvisation play notes randomly or based on experiences in order to find fantastic harmony, variables in the harmony search algorithm have random values or previously-memorized good values in order to find optimal solution.",

The chemical reactions are used as a paradigm to propose an optimization method that simulates these natural processes. The proposed algorithm is described in detail and then a set of typical complex benchmark functions is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed optimization algorithm can outperform other methods in a set of benchmark functions. This chemical reaction optimization paradigm is also applied to solve the tracking problem for the dynamic model of a unicycle mobile robot by integrating a kinematic and a torque controller based on fuzzy logic theory. Computer simulations are presented confirming that this optimization paradigm is able to outperform other optimization techniques applied to this particular robot application.",

            "description": "This book puts forward a new method for solving the text document (TD) clustering problem, which is established in two main stages: (i) A new feature selection method based on a particle swarm optimization algorithm with a novel weighting scheme is proposed, as well as a detailed dimension reduction technique, in order to obtain a new subset of more informative features with low-dimensional space. This new subset is subsequently used to improve the performance of the text clustering (TC) algorithm and reduce its computation time. The k-mean clustering algorithm is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the obtained subsets. (ii) Four krill herd algorithms (KHAs), namely, the (a) basic KHA, (b) modified KHA, (c) hybrid KHA, and (d) multi-objective hybrid KHA, are proposed to solve the TC problem; each algorithm represents an incremental improvement on its predecessor. For the evaluation process, seven benchmark text datasets are used with different characterizations and complexities. Text document (TD) clustering is a new trend in text mining in which the TDs are separated into several coherent clusters, where all documents in the same cluster are similar. The findings presented here confirm that the proposed methods and algorithms delivered the best results in comparison with other, similar methods to be found in the literature.",

            "description": "This textbook on practical data analytics unites fundamental principles, algorithms, and data. Algorithms are the keystone of data analytics and the focal point of this textbook. Clear and intuitive explanations of the mathematical and statistical foundations make the algorithms transparent. But practical data analytics requires more than just the foundations. Problems and data are enormously variable and only the most elementary of algorithms can be used without modification. Programming fluency and experience with real and challenging data is indispensable and so the reader is immersed in Python and R and real data analysis. By the end of the book, the reader will have gained the ability to adapt algorithms to new problems and carry out innovative analyses. This book has three parts:(a) Data Reduction: Begins with the concepts of data reduction, data maps, and information extraction. The second chapter introduces associative statistics, the mathematical foundation of scalable algorithms and distributed computing. Practical aspects of distributed computing is the subject of the Hadoop and MapReduce chapter.(b) Extracting Information from Data: Linear regression and data visualization are the principal topics of Part II. The authors dedicate a chapter to the critical domain of Healthcare Analytics for an extended example of practical data analytics. The algorithms and analytics will be of much interest to practitioners interested in utilizing the large and unwieldly data sets of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.(c) Predictive Analytics Two foundational and widely used algorithms, k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes, are developed in detail. A chapter is dedicated to forecasting. The last chapter focuses on streaming data and uses publicly accessible data streams originating from the Twitter API and the NASDAQ stock market in the tutorials. This book is intended for a one- or two-semester course in data analytics for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The prerequisites are kept low, and students with one or two courses in probability or statistics, an exposure to vectors and matrices, and a programming course will have no difficulty. The core material of every chapter is accessible to all with these prerequisites. The chapters often expand at the close with innovations of interest to practitioners of data science. Each chapter includes exercises of varying levels of difficulty. The text is eminently suitable for self-study and an exceptional resource for practitioners.",
