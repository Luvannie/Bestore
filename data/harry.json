            "description": "New York, mùa xuân năm 2008 Cả nước Mỹ đang ngày đêm sôi sục trong cuộc bầu cử tổng thống mới thì Marcus Goldman, một nhà văn trẻ có nhiều thành công lâm vào giai đoạn mất cảm hứng tạm thời: anh không thể sáng tác được một tiểu thuyết mới cho nhà xuất bản trong vài tháng tới. Khi sắp hết hạn, Marcus bất ngờ nhận được một cú điện thoại đã khiến cho mọi thứ hoàn toàn đảo lộn: Harry Quebert, giáo sư dạy anh hồi đại học, cũng là nhà văn lớn được cả đất nước kính trọng bị lật tẩy vì hành vi trong quá khứ: Ông bị kết tội giết một thiếu nữ 15 tuổi tên là Nola Kellergan sau khi có quan hệ tình ái với cô gái này. Tin tưởng bạn mình vô tội, Marcus quyết định quay về bang tiểu thuyết của Viện hàn lâm Pháp. Điều này chứng tỏ đây là một tác phẩm có khả năng chinh phục từ những độc giả trẻ nhất ở các trường cấp ba, cho tới một hội đồng giám khảo khó tính của Viện hàn lâm Pháp. Làm thế nào Joël Dicker lại có khả năng gặt hái được thành công vang dội đến vậy? Một cuộc điều tra đầy gay cấn với những chi tiết liên tục đánh lừa độc giả cùng những tình tiết bất ngờ thú vị xuyên suốt cuốn tiểu thuyết, có lẽ là lời giải thích xác đáng nhất về thành công của tác phẩm này. Cũng giống như Marcus Goldman, người đọc sẽ nhanh chóng bị các sự kiện ly kỳ đến nghẹt thở nhấn chìm. Kẻ nào trong số hàng chục nghi phạm là hung thủ giết chết thiếu nữ Nola, mà phải hơn 30 năm sau, bộ hài cốt mới bất ngờ được khai quật. Giáo sư đại học từng là người dẫn dắt chỉ bảo cho Marcus Goldman trong suốt nhiều năm trời, truyền cho anh 31 lời khuyên quý báu để trở thành nhà văn bỗng bất ngờ bị kết tội giết người và bị cả đất nước nhạo báng... Với cách viết “tiểu thuyết trong tiểu thuyết” và văn phong kịch tính rùng rợn kiểu Mỹ, Sự thật về vụ án Harry Quebert hay Chuyện nàng Nola được đánh giá là tác phẩm đã \"thổi bay\" Hỏa Ngục của Dan Brown khỏi vị trí đầu bảng ở châu Âu. Người đọc sẽ cùng trải nghiệm những suy nghĩ, trăn trở của chính tác giả về tình hình nước Mỹ, về những điều ngang trái trong xã hội hiện đại, về văn chương, về công lý và các phương tiện truyền thông. Xét trên góc độ tình cảm, đây là một câu chuyện tình yêu lãng mạn, và dạt dào xúc cảm. Lấy bối cảnh tại một vùng quê bình lặng, tù túng và đạo đức giả của Mỹ những năm 1970, thiếu nữ Nola đại diện cho nhân vật đa nhân cách, một Lolita trinh trắng, một nàng thơ khêu gợi cảm hứng sáng tác và một nữ thần trong tổ ấm của Harry Quebert, người hơn nàng những 17 tuổi đời. \"Sự thật về vụ án Harry Quebert hay Chuyện nàng Nola là “tiểu thuyết về nước Mỹ, tiểu thuyết về tình yêu, tiểu thuyết về quá trình học viết văn, tiểu thuyết về sự nổi tiếng, tiểu thuyết về sự thay đổi kì lạ trong cảm hứng, tiểu thuyết về những tiêu cực trong xã hội và truyền thông. Rất nhiều chủ đề được đề cập trong tác phẩm, nhưng trên hết, đó là kết quả từ khát vọng được kể một câu chuyện thật sự.” (Theo Landry Nicolas, Thạc sĩ ngôn ngữ học, Giáo viên tiếng Pháp).",

This collection of essays contributes to the scholarly discourse that forms Potter Studies. These essays take on the consideration of Rowling's work as being worthy of study as a phenomenon and influence, as well as a work of literary value. They add genuine statistical information about the reasons for the books' popularity, consider their effects on child readers, and examine some deep-rooted reasons for their having been manipulated in American publishing, in film adaptations, in musical complements, and in their thingification in popular culture around the world. Some of these essays take on the critics of the books' religion and considerations of psychological, as well as philosophical good and evil, and well as some stylistic anomalies. The fact that scholars from China, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Israel, in addition to English-speaking nations, have felt compelled to examine these books in detail testifies in part to Harry Potter's world-wide influence.",

After reading a letter from his mother, Burn cast the deciding vote to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting suffrage rights to millions of American women. Born and raised in McMinn County, he served in Tennessee government in various capacities for many years, including terms in the state senate and as delegate to state constitutional conventions. His accomplishments include helping secure universal suffrage rights, drafting clean election laws and leading successful careers in law and banking. He encountered more controversies in his career, such as an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid, election fraud and implementation of state legislative reapportionment. “In this deeply researched biography, Tyler L. Boyd finally brings us the full man, putting into context Burn’s singular act of conscience, helping us to understand how one person can make a difference.” —Elaine Weiss, author of The Woman’s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote “The story of what happened before and after Burn’s fateful vote has been told often but often told wrong. [This book] gives us the real story, one well worth remembering as we commemorate the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in August 1920, courtesy of the Volunteer State.” —Marjorie J. Spruill, author of Divided We Stand and One Woman, One Vote",

            "description": "Jeffrey Frank, author of the bestselling Ike and Dick, returns with the first full account of the Truman presidency in nearly thirty years, recounting how so ordinary a man met the extraordinary challenge of leading America through the pivotal years of the mid-20th century. The nearly eight years of Harry Truman’s presidency—among the most turbulent in American history—were marked by victory in the wars against Germany and Japan; the first use of an atomic weapon; the beginning of the Cold War; creation of the NATO alliance; the founding of the United Nations; the Marshall Plan to rebuild the wreckage of postwar Europe; the Red Scare; and the fateful decision to commit troops to fight in Korea. Historians have tended to portray Truman as stolid and decisive, with a homespun manner, but the man who emerges in The Trials of Harry S. Truman is complex and surprising. He believed that the point of public service was to improve the lives of one’s fellow citizens, and was disturbed by the brutal treatment of African Americans. Yet while he supported stronger civil rights laws, he never quite relinquished the deep-rooted outlook of someone with Confederate ancestry reared in rural Missouri. He was often carried along by the rush of events and guided by men who succeeded in refining his fixed and facile view of the postwar world. And while he prided himself on his Midwestern rationality, he could act out of emotion, as when, in the aftermath of World War II, moved by the plight of refugees, he pushed to recognize the new state of Israel. The Truman who emerges in these pages is a man with generous impulses, loyal to friends and family, and blessed with keen political instincts, but insecure, quick to anger, and prone to hasty decisions. Archival discoveries, and research that led from Missouri to Washington, Berlin and Korea, have contributed to an indelible, and deeply human, portrait of an ordinary man suddenly forced to shoulder extraordinary responsibilities, who never lost a schoolboy’s romantic love for his country, and its Constitution.",

During the Second World War, he became chief advisor on international financial policy to Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, a role that would take him to Bretton Woods, where he would make a lasting impact on the architecture of postwar international finance. However, charges of espionage, followed by his dramatic testimony before the House Un‑American Activities Committee and death from a heart attack a few days later, obscured his importance in setting the terms for the modern global economy. In this book, James Boughton rehabilitates White, delving into his life and work and returning him to a central role as the architect of the world’s financial system.",

K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series—magical stories centered on one boy’s adventures at Hogwarts, a school for witchcraft and wizardry. Yet this popular series presents a perplexing—even divisive—challenge to the Christian community. Although the books present a clear picture of the epic battle between good and evil, they appear to support the use of magic and have had a controversial impact on our culture. As a result, many of us are wondering, “How should I respond to this Harry Potter thing?” Find out what the Harry Potter books really say about witchcraft and wizardry. Hear what Christians on both sides of the debate are saying about Harry Potter—and decide what you believe. Learn how you can use the series to protect your child from real occult influences. In What’s a Christian to Do with Harry Potter?, you’ ll explore the valid concerns some Christians have about the series, sort out the fact and fiction at the center of the debate, discover biblical answers that may surprise you, and learn how you can tap into this powerful cultural phenomenon to help advance the kingdom of God. This book has not been prepared, approved, or licensed by any person or entity that created, published, or produced the Harry Potter books or related properties.",

In that regard, senior executives attached particular importance to the budding United Nations organization, a transnational institution which notably President Truman viewed as one of the seminal centrepieces of world peace and security. Two vital speeches delivered by Truman in the spring and early summer of 1945 amply reflected this sentiment.",

            "description": "Seminar paper from the year 2008 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 2, University of Frankfurt (Main), language: English, abstract: Harry Potter is a heptalogy of fantasy novels by the English author Joanne K. Rowling about an adolescent boy named Harry Potter, first published in England in 1997. Harry Potter attends the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a boarding school for young wizards and witches. Up to his eleventh birthday his cruel relatives, the Dursleys, have raised the orphaned Harry. On this day he learns that he is a wizard and has been invited to attend Hogwarts. The story is mostly set on the school premises, with each of the seven volumes describing a school year at Hogwarts and a year of Harry's growing-up. The main topic is Harry Potter's fight against the evil wizard Lord Voldemort who killed Harry's parents when he was still an infant. Throughout the story the Dark Lord Voldemort gains more and more power and tries to kill Harry several times. In Hallows the climax is reached and the final battle between Harry and Lord Voldemort which will decide the future of the wizarding world. The fight of good versus evil is one of the oldest topics of mankind. Starting with the original sin in the Garden of Eden this fight has dominated moral concepts of the Christian world ever since. This paper presents an analysis of how good and evil are portrayed and presented in the Harry Potter series. First, there is a description of Christian motifs in the series and how these motifs can be compared to certain characters in the books. Second, 'good' characters such as Harry's close friends Ron and Hermione, and Harry's mentor, Professor Dumbledore, are described and characterised as to why they are part of the 'good'. Third, the 'evil' opponents Draco Malfoy and the evil Dark Lord Voldemort are analysed as to how they exhibit 'evil' behaviour. The last chapter deals with the question of whether Harry Potter is 'good' or 'evil' as he does not always act as an exemplary student.",

From his earliest public appearances as a mischievous redheaded toddler, Prince Harry has captured the hearts of royal enthusiasts around the world. In Harry, Britain's leading expert on the young royals offers an in-depth look at the wayward prince turned national treasure. Nicholl sheds new light on growing up royal, Harry's relationship with his mother, his troubled youth and early adulthood, and how his military service in Afghanistan inspired him to create his legacy, the Invictus Games. Harry: Life, Loss, and Love features interviews with friends, those who have worked with the prince, and former Palace aides. Nicholl explores Harry's relationship with his family, in particular, the Queen, his father, stepmother, and brother, and reveals his secret \"second family\" in Botswana. She uncovers new information about his former girlfriends and chronicles his romance and engagement to American actress Meghan Markle. Harry is a compelling portrait of one of the most popular members of the royal family, and reveals the inside story of the most intriguing royal romance in a decade.",

Wild certainly never entered into the description. That is, until she met powerful Australian businessman Harry Griffith. Suddenly, Amy was doing all kinds of wild things—enjoying romantic dinners, taking spontaneous luxury vacations, falling in love. And yet, a part of her was still devoted to her husband, still wanted to touch him, hold him, talk to him. But Harry demanded nothing less than all of Amy. How could she love Harry, without betraying her husband?",

The Prince who has the power to make or break. The maverick Prince, who is brilliant, impetuous and unpredictable. The Prince who with his unique talents, charm and bloody-minded determination is changing lives across the world. But the Prince who could, in a moment of madness, bring it all crashing down. He is the redhead that Diana called 'the spare', whose childhood was one of chaos and loss; the little boy walking behind his mother's cortege who broke our hearts. This is the story of how he survived the loss and chaos; how he lived in the shadow of his older, cleverer, more important brother - until suddenly he discovered there was something he could do better than almost anyone. This is the story of how the troubled teenager grew into a leader of men, a soldier, a pilot, an adventurer and a passionate champion of those who are in danger of being destroyed or forgotten. Written with the help of many of the most important people in his life, this is the first authoritative biography of this most delightful, charismatic and dangerous of the Queen's grandsons.",

It's hard to believe, but 20 years have passed since a baby-faced Daniel Radcliffe took the screen test that would lead to him becoming Harry Potter for an entire generation of movie-goers. And now it's time to introduce a new generation to the magic that is the Harry Potter films. Join Cecilia Tan, a writer, editor, and devoted Harry Potter fan, as she takes you back to Hogwarts, through a fan-centric guided tour of all eight movies in THE BINGE WATCHER'S GUIDE TO THE HARRY POTTER FILMS where you can re-live all the excitement and wonder of seeing Harry hop on his broom for the very first time. Tan will guide you through loving, fun--yet occasionally snarky--recaps of each film, as well slather on many behind-the-scenes facts and stories about how the films were made. Casting decisions, near misses, movie artistry: she’ll cover it all, and more, as well as critical analysis of the films' significance in pop culture, filmmaking, and history. Not only that, since this is a Binge Watcher's Guide, Tan shares actual tips for binge watching, including recipes and suggestions for hosting your own Harry Potter themed binge-watching party.",
